# Styles and Layouts

These two commands are your friends. They will run the linters, fix what they can automatically, and tell you about what they can't fix so that you can take manual action:

```bash
npx eslint . --fix               # <-- for the JS linter
npx stylelint "**/*.css" --fix   # <-- for the CSS linter
```
